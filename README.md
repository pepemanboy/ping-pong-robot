# Gripping of moving objects in optimal time by a robotic arm

I developed this project as part of my research internship at Polytechnique Montreal. The aim of the project was to grasp moving objects with an assistive robotic arm. I developed the architecture of the system, as well as algorithms to identify a pingpong ball, estimate its trajectory, and move the robot arm to intercept it.

The full description of the project can be found in [this paper](https://github.com/pepemanboy/ping-pong-robot/blob/master/Report.pdf)

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FW8gi3knTU&t=1s) describes the project and shows it working.
